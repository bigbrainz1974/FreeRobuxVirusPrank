# FreeRobuxVirusPrank
My newest website is a really dumb prank. I coded a website that had a button that downloads a really dumb harmless virus that does nothing other than making a popup warning sign with messages beginning with"There is a a really dangerous virus on your computer" and ending with "This was a prank. Trololololololololo." The website was a free Robux scam, but honestly this website is just a script kiddie. I'm posting the virus code as well so you can see how harmless it is.
